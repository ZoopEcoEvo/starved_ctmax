<h1 id="starvation-reduces-thermal-limits-of-the-widespread-copepod-acartia-tonsa">Starvation
reduces thermal limits of the widespread copepod <em>Acartia
tonsa</em></h1>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The acquisition of nutrition is a fundamental challenge for
organisms. While environmental conditions are often considered to impact
the ability to find, capture, and ingest food, nutrition also affects
how environmental conditions impact organisms. In a changing climate,
these feedbacks between feeding and sensitivity to environmental
conditions are crucial to consider. [Summary of climate change,
temperature, and food availability in the ocean; Are copepods currently
or predicted to be exposed to food limitation?].</p>
<p>[Summary of starvation effects on thermal limits literature]. It is
vital to understand how copepod thermal limits respond to changes in
food availability in order to better model population dynamics in a
changing climate.</p>
<p>Copepods are the some of the most abundant animals on the planet, and
dominate planktonic communities in the coastal ocean. By nature of their
abundance this group plays key ecological roles in aquatic food webs. In
many systems, copepods are important consumers of primary productivity,
acting as a crucial linkage between phytoplankton and higher trophic
levels. Further, many commercial fish larvae depend on copepods as a
critical food source during development. Climate change therefore has
the potential to impact aquatic ecosystem functions as well as human
fishery systems directly through changes in copepod populations.
However, despite their abundance and ecological importance, there is
limited data on environmental control of copepod thermal limits,
including the effects of starvation. This impedes our ability to predict
how copepod populations may be affected by co-occurring changes in
temperature and food availability over both short (e.g. - seasonal
changes) and long timescales (e.g. - anthropogenic climate change). In
this study we tracked changes in critical thermal maxima (CTmax) in
copepods exposed to extended starvation to test the hypothesis that food
deprivation would reduce thermal limits. We observed a clear decline in
thermal limits after three days of starvation. Our results suggest that
natural variability in food concentrations in the coastal ocean may
reduce copepod thermal limits thus increasing vulnerability to
increasing temperatures, especially during marine heatwaves.</p>
<h1 id="methods">Methods</h1>
<p>The copepods used in this study were collected in July 2020 from
Esker Point, Connecticut (lat, long) by surface tow with a 63-um mesh
net and solid cod end. Mature <em>Acartia tonsa</em> females and males
were isolated from the tow contents, and used to initiate a laboratory
culture which was maintained in an environmental chamber at 18°C and a
12:12 light:dark cycle, with constant aeration from a small aquarium
pump. Copepods were fed <em>ad libitum</em> a mixture of three
phytoplankton cultured under the same environmental conditions: a green
flagellate, <em>Tetraselmis sp.</em>; the cryptomonad <em>Rhodomonas
sp.</em>; and the small diatom <em>Thalassiosira weissflogii</em>. This
diet is regularly used to maintain large, active laboratory cultures of
<em>A. tonsa</em> (REF).</p>
<p>We used five replicate experiments to test our hypothesis that
starvation would reduce copepod thermal limits over time. Each
experiment involved measuring a baseline thermal limits for the culture
(as critical thermal maxima: CTmax), and then tracking CTmax over time
in two groups of copepods, a fed control group and a starved treatment
group. To initiate each experiment, 10 mature females were isolated from
the laboratory culture and maintained for 24 hours in 200 mL of an
<em>ad libitum</em> food solution (800 ug C / L of
<em>Tetraselmis</em>). Preliminary work showed that short exposure to
three different prey options (<em>Tetraselmis sp.</em>, <em>Rhodomonas
sp.</em>, and <em>Oxyrrhis marina</em>, a heterotrophic dinoflagellate)
did not affect copepod thermal limits (Supp. Fig. 1). After 24 hours,
thermal limits were measured as Critical Thermal Maxima (CTmax;
described in the following section), which served as a baseline initial
value for each experiment. On the same day as the baseline CTmax
measurements, an additional ~90 mature females were isolated and divided
into six groups. The six groups were randomly assigned to either the
starvation treatment or the fed control treatment. The starvation groups
were maintained in 0.2-um filtered sea water. The control group was
provided a food solution comprising 800 ug C / L of
<em>Tetraselmis</em>, identical to the conditions used to assess
baseline CTmax. Each group was held in a 100 mL cup with a plastic
cylinder nested within. The bottom end of the cylinder was covered by a
150-um mesh screen. Similar set-ups are often used to prevent egg
cannibalization during egg production assays, as eggs of <em>A.
tonsa</em> sink through the mesh to the base of the cup; in our case,
this prevented females in the starvation group from acquiring nutrition
via egg cannibalism. All groups were transferred to fresh media (either
filtered sea water or food solution) on a daily basis throughout the
experiment by gently removing the meshed column and placing it into a
new 100 mL cup.</p>
<p>Thermal limits were measured each day for five days, starting 24
hours after the females were isolated using a custom setup. The
apparatus used has three components: a reservoir, a water bath, and a
temperature sensor (Supp. Fig. 2). We used a 5 gallon bucket covered
with a neoprene sleeve as our reservoir. The reservoir was filled with
~20 L of water, which is then slowly warmed using a 300 watt aquarium
water heater (BRAND). In this arrangement, the temperature ramping rate
is determined by the interaction between the power output of the
aquarium heater and the volume of water in the reservoir. The reservoir
also contains two aquarium pumps (BRAND), one of which circulates water
within the reservoir while the other pumps water from the reservoir into
the water bath, which sits atop the reservoir. The water bath is a
transparent plexiglass box that fits over the opening of the reservoir.
Water is pumped up from the reservoir at a rapid rate, flooding the
water bath. A recession cut into one of the edges of the box allows
water to spill back into the reservoir. The water bath contains several
test-tube holders that are used to secure the experimental vessels (50
mL flat-bottom glass vials) during the CTmax trials. Because the box is
transparent, individuals are easily monitored through the side of the
water bath throughout the trial, eliminating the necessity to remove
experimental vessels from the water bath, potentially inducing
temperature fluctuations. The final component of this apparatus is a
small Arduino computer system that logs temperature with three
independent sensors at 5 second intervals. These sensors are small
enough to be placed inside the same experimental vessels used during the
CTmax trials, providing a continuous record of the temperatures within
the vessels. No horizontal gradients in temperature were detected within
the water bath, and temperatures are averaged across the three
sensors.</p>
<p>Using this setup, we measured individual CTmax values for ten
copepods per day, selected at random from the six cups. One replicate
experiment (replicate 2) was ended after only __ days when all
individuals from the starvation treatment died. At the beginning of each
CTmax trial, the reservoir was filled with 20 L of water and adjusted to
18°C. After the reservoir reached the proper temperature, experimental
vessels containing 10 mL of 0.2 um filtered sea water were placed in the
water bath, which was then flooded with water, bringing the experimental
vessels to the correct temperature as well. Individual copepods were
then placed into the vials, and let acclimate for 10 minutes at constant
temperature. All copepods were checked during this time period for
normal behavior. Individuals exhibiting abnormal behaviors were excluded
from further analysis. After this resting phase, the water heater was
turned on, initiating the temperature ramp. Simultaneously, the
temperature logger began to record temperature and a stop watch began
recording the time passed. Individuals were continuously monitored as
water temperature increased. CTmax is generally defined as the
temperature at which an individual ceases to respond to physical stimuli
(REF), indicating the onset of “ecological death” (the inability to
escape lethal temperatures, predators, etc.). In <em>A. tonsa</em> this
is indicated by cessation of movement, a lack of response to gentle
physical stimuli (e.g. - slow flushing of the water in the tube with a
transfer pipette), and abnormal body configuration (specifically -
antennules pressed against the sides of prosome and a distinct dorsal
tilt of the urosome). The time at which an individual began to exhibit
these characteristics was recorded and that individual’s experimental
vessel removed from the water bath. After all individuals reached their
CTmax, copepods were photographed using a camera attached to an inverted
scope (or the equivalent), and body size estimated using a scale
micrometer and the software ImageJ (REF). Individuals from replicate
experiment 5 were not photographed due to a malfunction with the imaging
software.</p>
<p>The times recorded during the trials were converted to the CTmax
values in degrees C using temperatures recorded on the temperature
logging system. There is an “uncertainty window” for each measurement,
however, that also has to be accounted for - as there are between 1-10
vials being monitored at any point in the trial, the time at which an
individual was recorded as having stopped responding to stimulus
corresponds with the latest time (and therefore highest temperature) it
could have reached its CTmax. The period of time during which an
individual could have reached its CTmax extends from this definite end
point to the last time the individual was checked. As it generally takes
around 5 seconds to check whether an individual has stopped responding,
the duration of this uncertainty window was estimated for each
individual as the number of vials remaining in the water bath multiplied
by 5 seconds. This uncertainty window decreased in length as the trial
went on, until, for the final individual, the window includes just the
amount of time it took to check whether the individual had stopped
responding. CTmax is estimated as the average temperatures recorded by
all three temperature sensors throughout the uncertainty window. We used
this time-based method instead of directly monitoring the temperatures
to reduce any sub-conscious bias stemming from past knowledge or
expectations about copepod thermal limits.</p>

<p>The custom setup produced consistent ramping rates across assays
(Supp. Fig. 3). Ramping rates did however vary within each assay,
decreasing over time due to the imperfect insulation of the bucket
reservoir. Ramping rates always between the target ramping rates of 0.1
- 0.3°C per minute, however, which have been used previously to measure
CTmax for copepods (REF).</p>
<p>A total of 254 CTmax measurements were made across the five replicate
experiments (153 from the fed controls and 101 from the starved
treatment). Average CTmax gradually decreased over the course of the
five day starvation period (Figure 1). There was no difference between
thermal limits of fed and starved individuals on days 1 or 2. Thermal
limits were ~1°C lower by day 3 and continued to decrease by ~2°C per
day after that. By day 5, starved individuals had thermal limits that
were ~5°C lower than those of control individuals. There was, however,
also a large increase in the variance of individual thermal limits in
the starved treatment; several individuals maintaining thermal limits
similar to those observed in the control individuals while others had
thermal limits as low as 22°C. No changes were observed between the fed
controls and the baseline CTmax values during any of the experiments
(Supp. Fig. 4). There was no significant effect of size on CTmax during
any of the experimental days (Supp. Fig. 5).</p>
